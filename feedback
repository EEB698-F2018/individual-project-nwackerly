Feedback for Nicole Wackerly

Oct 1: Nice use of the data & wrangling folders. Should add a "raw" folder in "data", and a "documents" folder for the dmp and the analysis/
outline document. 
Dec 3: Folder structure looks good. I think you have two versions of DMP - can delete the one in the main folder. 
Also, there are some weird temp folders that I think you can delete. Be sure to upload your ppt to the docs folder too. Nice work!

Dec 18: Overall looks good. I don't see your written methods & results document, though - is it in there? I look forward to seeing these data published- you've made a lot of progress on this!
